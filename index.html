            <li>1928- British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, Rai died of a heart attack. Enraged by his incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai's death and teamed up with other revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to make a plan to kill Scott.</li>
            <li>1929- Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity.

            <li>1931 - Singh's growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the Lahore Conspiracy Case.
